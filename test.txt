I go to places and see people I'd like to meet but I'm too shy to say anything. I place ads on craigslist to try and find them.
I met someone years ago and I'm wondering if they still think about me. 
I want to hook up with somebody. There was a cute person at my gym I want to go home with.
I take missed connections and use them to generate new missed connections.
Maybe we can laugh at some of these.
We met today but I didn't get you name. I missed making connections with you.
